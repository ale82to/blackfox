# blackfox
Blackfox a fenix based browser but  with many features and freedom.
here' s some of the features i ve implemented in black fox:

1)Black amoled theme, (*bonus dark mode for web content adding a ublock custom filter*)

2)Based on nighly but tested for stability and about:config available

3)Unlimited Top sites

4)idrid user interface with tablet control in url bar and here's come some magic: a simple but useful close tab button in url bar(long press it to quickly add url to top sites) ,back button(long press it to quickly show bookmarks),forward button (long press it to quickly show history) and reload button(long press it to trigger search in page action).

5)Extensions icons in url bar ,honestly i think fenix + ublock is really a killer combo so i wanted its icon to be always visible in url bar!

6)Data collection and analitycs disabled by default.

7)no tracking adds or so whatever! if you like or find my work useful just donate:
